# Roadmap: Real Estate SaaS Platform — MVP

**Defined:** 2026-05-31
**Revised:** 2026-06-01
**Granularity:** Standard (5-7 phases, 3-5 plans each)
**Project mode:** single-account-first
**Parallel execution:** enabled

> **Version 2 Note:** Shopify-style multi-tenant SaaS (self-service signup, subdomain routing, account self-onboarding) is **Version 2**. This roadmap covers the MVP — building one complete site as a proof of concept, then making it repeatable for future clients.

---

## MVP Scope

**Current target:** Build one complete website + CMS for a demo client (e.g., Airbnb host or real estate agent).

**What we deliver:**
- Complete frontend website (property listings, detail pages, inquiry form)
- CMS backend for the client to manage properties
- Search, maps, and POI integration
- SEO-optimized pages

**What's NOT in MVP:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure
- Self-service account signup
- Subdomain or custom domain routing per account
- Template system for cloning sites
